                    Say No to Ragging: Creating a Safe Environment at GLA University

At GLA University, we are committed to fostering a learning environment that prioritizes respect, kindness, and inclusivity. Ragging is strictly prohibited on our campus, as it undermines the values we hold dear and jeopardizes the well-being of our students.<br>

Ragging, in any form, goes against the principles of a healthy academic community. It not only hampers the academic pursuits of individuals but also leaves lasting emotional scars. At GLA, we believe in nurturing a culture of camaraderie and support among our students.<br>

We firmly stand against any form of harassment, bullying, or intimidation. Our commitment to creating a safe and welcoming space is reflected in our zero-tolerance policy towards ragging. We urge all students to embrace the spirit of friendship and cooperation rather than engaging in activities that harm the dignity of their peers.<br>

It is the responsibility of each member of the GLA community to report any incidents of ragging promptly. We have established mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality and protection of those who come forward to report such behavior. By doing so, you contribute to the maintenance of a campus that upholds the highest standards of respect and empathy.<br>

Remember, GLA University is a place where everyone has the right to learn, grow, and thrive without fear. Let us work together to create an environment where every student feels safe, valued, and free to pursue their academic journey without hindrance.<br>

Together, we can ensure that GLA remains a haven of learning, devoid of the negative impact of ragging. Say no to ragging, and let us build a community that thrives on mutual respect and support.
