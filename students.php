                        extra
                        curricular activities.The best part about NIT Trichy is that the intake of students is from all
                        over
                        India of different states/culture/language. As most of the students stay in hostel, it gives
                        them a
                        chance to really know about each other. Everyone learns to respect the different lifestyle of
                        each
                        individual. Participation in Extracurricular activities like NSO, NCC, NSS, literary clubs,
                        trekking
                        clubs, photographic clubs and students' chapters of professional societies give student ample
